Warm data node : 
Warm data nodes are part of the warm tier. 
Time series data can move to the warm tier once it is being queried less frequently than the recently-indexed data in the hot tier.


Add the following configuration to config file.
/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml

# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for your cluster:
#
cluster.name: elk-cluster
#
# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for the node:
#
node.name: warm-node
#
# Add custom attributes to the node:
#
#node.attr.rack: r1
#
node.roles: [ data_warm ]
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------
#
# By default Elasticsearch is only accessible on localhost. Set a different
# address here to expose this node on the network:
#
network.host: 0.0.0.0
#
# By default Elasticsearch listens for HTTP traffic on the first free port it
# finds starting at 9200. Set a specific HTTP port here:
#
http.port: 9200
#
# For more information, consult the network module documentation.
#
# --------------------------------- Discovery ----------------------------------
#
# Pass an initial list of hosts to perform discovery when this node is started:
# The default list of hosts is ["127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]
#
discovery.seed_hosts: ["192.168.1.176", "192.168.1.134", "192.168.1.175", "192.168.1.110"]
#
# Bootstrap the cluster using an initial set of master-eligible nodes:
#
cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["192.168.1.176"]
#
# For more information, consult the discovery and cluster formation module documentation.
