In this Multi node cluster there are multiple nodes in the cluster:
Master, Cordinator, Hot, Warm

Master Node : 
The master node is responsible for lightweight cluster-wide actions such as creating or deleting an index, tracking which nodes are part of the cluster, 
and deciding which shards to allocate to which nodes. It is important for cluster health to have a stable master node.

Master Node/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
Change the following condition for master node configuration.

# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for your cluster:
#
cluster.name: elk-cluster
#
# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for the node:
#
node.name: master
#
# Add custom attributes to the node:
#
#node.attr.rack: r1
#
#node.master: true
#node.data: false
#
node.roles: [ master ]
# --------------------------------- Discovery ----------------------------------
#
# Pass an initial list of hosts to perform discovery when this node is started:
# The default list of hosts is ["127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]
#
discovery.seed_hosts: ["192.168.1.176", "192.168.1.134", "192.168.1.175", "192.168.1.110"]
#
# Bootstrap the cluster using an initial set of master-eligible nodes:
#
cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["192.168.1.176"]
#
# For more information, consult the discovery and cluster formation module documentation.


By default, a node gets the master and data role. So if you have started it already, it should already contain some data, 
and thus, cannot be transformed to a master node unless you first move all the data it contains on another node.

You first need to decommission the node by running this command (use the right IP address for your node) 
in order to move all the data it contains on other data nodes:

PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "transient" : {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.exclude._ip" : "10.0.0.1"
  }
}

When the node doesn't contain any data anymore, you can shut it down, change node.roles to master and restart it.

Restart the elasticsearch.

now check from the dev-tools
GET _cat/nodes
GET _cluster/health
PUT _cluster/settings
